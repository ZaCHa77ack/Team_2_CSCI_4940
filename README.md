This is a project for CSCI 4940 (Capstone) - developed by Zachary Turner and Michael Andrew Ellis.

For the time being, it is using starter assets supplied by Unity Learn, but those are subject to change as the project progresses.

We do not have an html page nor javascript for the project. However, we will be attempting to integrate the Unity ML Agents into this project in order to create enemy AI.
